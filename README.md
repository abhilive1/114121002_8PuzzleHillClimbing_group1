8 Puzzles Problem with variations of Hill Climbling method
# Example
Initial State:
2  8  3
1  6  4
7  _  5

Goal State:
1  2  3
8  _  4
7  6  5
The goal is to achieve the goal state from any random initial configuration using heuristic-based algorithms involves:

Defining the goal and initial state.
Navigating through the state space efficiently using heuristics.
Employing algorithms like A* or Greedy Best-First Search to find the path to the goal state.
Heuristic-based algorithms enhance the search process by making it more targeted and efficient, though they do not always guarantee the optimal solution.
